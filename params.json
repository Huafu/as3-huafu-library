{"body":"Huafu AS3 Library\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis library is full of many AS3 classes that can be used to manipulate data/visual elements in a relatively quick and easy way.\r\nBut the main big stuff is the ORM and ActiveRecord like addition that it provides with help of the com.huafu.sql.orm package.\r\n\r\nThe API doc is on GitHub pages [here](http://pedroleouf.github.com/huafu-as3-library).\r\n\r\nIt's still in early (even if quite big already) development stage so more help coming up after the first beta version will be tagged.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to contribute, please feel free to contact me at huafu DOT gandon AT gmail DOT com\r\n","tagline":"Huafu open source Library","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
