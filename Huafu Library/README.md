Huafu AS3 Library
=============

This library is full of many AS3 classes that can be used to manipulate data/visual elements in a relatively quick and easy way.
But the main big stuff is the ORM and ActiveRecord like addition that it provides with help of the com.huafu.sql.* packages.

The API doc is on GitHub pages [here](http://huafu.github.com/as3-huafu-library/asdoc-output/).

It's still in early (even if quite big already) development stage so more information coming up after the first beta version will be tagged.
